            <h4> This is my hamster hammy! He is a very cute gray/white colored Syrian Hamster. He is now two and a half years old, which is roughly eighty-five years old in human years! When he was young, he loved to adventure and explore. He would exercise on his wheel daily for hours a night. Now, he has slowed down a lot and enjoys the slow pace of life. He now spends most his time burrowing and sleeping more. His preferences for food has also changed and he loves eating soft baby food. He has brought so much happiness and joy into my life, I could not imagine a life without him. I am so privileged to watch him grow and live, and I would not trade him for the world.</h4>
