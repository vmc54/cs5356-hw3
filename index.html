                <figcaption>This is my cute hamster, Hammy! He is currently two and a half years old, which is 85 years old in human years. He used to be very active and run on his wheel but nowadays he prefers sleeping and eating soft baby food. He's very independent and prefers his alone-time. For just an adoption fee of $20, he has brought so much happiness into my life. I could not imagine a life where I never adopted him. He is so important to me and I love him so much. </figcaption>
